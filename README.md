### Bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront command line node application. 

### Customer View
The customer view portion of the app is meant to take in orders and manage stock from the store's inventory. If they would like to purchase items, the app shows them all the products available . It then allows the user to choose the product they would like based on the item ID and the amount they would like. If the amount they would like the purchase is valid, then the customer will be given the total price and the inventory will be updated. It then allows the customer to buy more items if he/she would like to do so.
